# Walking through the world of SCP

## What's this?
- A wiki for those who want to check the SCPs and tales in which their favorite SCPs appear.
- You can also enjoy the visualization of SCP network [here]('/scp_network_visualization.md').

## Data collection
- The data were collected from [SCP Foundation](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/) on February 17, 2021.
- The list of tales for each SCP is made by scanning all the tales in [Tales by Title](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tales-by-title) and scraping [SCP Tales by Series](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-series-1-tales-edition/noredirect/true).
